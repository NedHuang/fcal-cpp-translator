1. Duplication test code. Handled by Sophia.
When testing that our scanner made and matched token types properly, we previously had many multi-line test cases that would make tokens and assertions for every type. We condensed all the repetetive code into a helper function to then be called by each test, making the tests one line each.
2. Only one call to makeRegex per token type. Handled by Lee.
We had all the makeRegex calls within the scan functio of the scanner class. We moved all of these into a constructor for Scanner.
3. No redundant arrays of tokenType.
We never had these in the first place.
4. Minor re-ordering of TokenEnumType values OK. Handled by Lee
This wasn't an issue in our original iteration, but when we made these modifications we made sure that nothing was more dependent on the enum order than was necessary.
5. No named regex_t fields. Handled by Lee.
When we moved all the makeRegex calls to the Scanner constructor, we filled out a regex_t array with each regex.
6. No use of integer literals in place of tokenType values. 
We never hard-coded any integers when referring to tokenTypes.
Testing: We used black box testing to check that all our improvements worked by running "make run-tests"
