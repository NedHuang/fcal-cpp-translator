Joint work: half of the cppCode() functions in ast.cpp were done together during lab hours.
Roles for division of work and ideas for implementation of the matrix class and what kind of
FCAL programs to write were also done together in lab.
Lee: Implemented the Matrix class for cpp code.
  Found most of the bugs in the cppCode() functions as well as parser fixes.
Sophia: Wrote FCAL programs and the cppCode() functions that weren't completed jointly. 
  Helped find some of the bugs in the cppCode() functions and parser.
