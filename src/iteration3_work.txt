The basics for the UML diagrams and how the ast would be implemented 
were decided together (of course).
In general, the work was split between Lee working with anything dealing with Stmt and Stmts code, 
while Sophia did Expr and Decl things. (Root and Node handled together)
After initial implementation of the ast, Sophia worked on dOxygen code and commenting, 
especially in parser.cpp and ast.h and .cpp, as well as updating the UML diagram, 
while Lee worked on debugging and catching errors and typos.
